abstract = {This paper presents a highly efficient, very accurate regression approach for face alignment. Our approach has two novel components: a set of local binary features, and a locality principle for learning those features. The locality principle guides us to learn a set of highly discriminative local binary features for each facial landmark independently. The obtained local binary features are used to jointly learn a linear regression for the final output. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results when tested on the current most challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, because extracting and regressing local binary features is computationally very cheap, our system is much faster than previous methods. It achieves over 3,000 fps on a desktop or 300 fps on a mobile phone for locating a few dozens of landmarks.},

@article{Xiong2014,
abstract = {Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment, structure from motion) are solved with nonlinear optimization methods. It is generally accepted that second order descent methods are the most robust, fast, and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth function. However, in the context of computer vision, second order descent methods have two main drawbacks: (1) the function might not be analytically differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical, and (2) the Hessian may be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this paper proposes generic descent maps, which are average "descent directions" and rescaling factors learned in a supervised fashion. Using generic descent maps, we derive a practical algorithm - Supervised Descent Method (SDM) - for minimizing Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problems. During training, SDM learns a sequence of decent maps that minimize the NLS. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the learned descent maps without computing the Jacobian or the Hessian. We prove the conditions under which the SDM is guaranteed to converge. We illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of SDM in three computer vision problems: rigid image alignment, non-rigid image alignment, and 3D pose estimation. In particular, we show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the problem of facial feature detection. The code has been made available at www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/intraface.},

We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.},

@article{Sagonas2013,
abstract = {Developing powerful deformable face models requires massive, annotated face databases on which techniques can be trained, validated and tested. Manual annotation of each facial image in terms of landmarks requires a trained expert and the workload is usually enormous. Fatigue is one of the reasons that in some cases annotations are inaccurate. This is why, the majority of existing facial databases provide annotations for a relatively small subset of the training images. Furthermore, there is hardly any correspondence between the annotated land-marks across different databases. These problems make cross-database experiments almost infeasible. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a semi-automatic annotation methodology for annotating massive face datasets. This is the first attempt to create a tool suitable for annotating massive facial databases. We employed our tool for creating annotations for MultiPIE, XM2VTS, AR, and FRGC Ver. 2 databases. The annotations will be made publicly available from http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/ resources/facial-point-annotations/. Finally, we present experiments which verify the accuracy of produced annotations.},

The main goal to use this method is to apply to forensic analysis or pornographic images detection on storage devices such as hard disk, USB memories, etc. The results obtained using the proposed method are compared with Paraben’s Porn Detection Stick software which is one of the most commercial devices used for detecting pornographic images. The proposed algorithm achieved identify up to 88.8\% of the explicit content images, and 5\% of false positives, the Paraben’s Porn Detection Stick software achieved 89.7\% of effectiveness for the same set of images but with a 6.8\% of false positives. In both cases were used a set of 1000 images, 550 natural images, and 450 with highly explicit content. Finally the proposed algorithm effectiveness shows that the methodology applied to explicit image detection was successfully proved vs Paraben’s Porn Detection Stick software.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method which combines the effectiveness of a discriminative object detector with the explicit correspondence offered by a nearest-neighbor approach. The method is based on training a separate linear SVM classifier for every exemplar in the training set. Each of these Exemplar-SVMs is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. While each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such Exemplar-SVMs offers surprisingly good generalization. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of Felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. But the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. Because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3D model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.},

However, the presence of hair and other skin attributes makes the automatic detection of ear contour a real challenge for online applications. This paper presents an online biometric authentication using ear contours acquired from a robust peg free acquisition set up. The Gaussian classifiers are used to first segment the skin and non-skin areas in the ear images. Laplacian of Gaussian is then used to compute edges of the skin areas, which helped to get ear-ROI images. A localized region based active contour is finally located in the ear-ROI images. The ear-contours are then employed for the authentication using log Gabor and SIFT features. The experimental results carried out on 700 ear images confirm the utility of the proposed approach.},

The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that \&amp;\#x201C;classical\&amp;\#x201D; flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. Moreover, we find that while median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization is a key to recent performance gains, it leads to higher energy solutions. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective includes a nonlocal term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that ranks at the top of the Middlebury benchmark.},

By adopting the sliding window approach and a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the efficacy of the HCS feature is assessed on a 3D ear detection task. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach achieves a perfect detection rate, i.e., a 100\% detection rate with a 0\% false positive rate, on a validation set consisting of 142 range profile images from the University of Notre Dame (UND) 3D ear biometrics database. It is to the best of our knowledge that the detection rate achieved here outperforms those reported in the literature for the given dataset.

A cost function involving nonrigid shape as well as rigid pose is proposed. Registration is performed by minimizing a first-order approximation of the cost function in the Iterative Closest Points framework. We show how a complex shape model, consisting of multiple PCA mod- els for individual regions of the template, can be seamlessly integrated in the parameter estimation scheme. An appro- priate Tikhonov regularization is introduced to guarantee the smoothness of the full mesh despite the splitting into lo- cal models. The proposed algorithm is compared to a re- cent generic nonrigid registration scheme. We show that the data-driven approach is faster, as the linear systems to be solved in the iterations are significantly smaller when a model is available. Also, we show that simultaneous opti- mization of pose and shape yields better registration results than shape alone.},

abstract = {As the size of the available collections of 3D objects grows, database transactions become essential for their management with the key operation being retrieval (query). Large collections are also precategorized into classes so that a single class contains objects of the same type (e.g., human faces, cars, four-legged animals). It is shown that general object retrieval methods are inadequate for intraclass retrieval tasks. We advocate that such intraclass problems require a specialized method that can exploit the basic class characteristics in order to achieve higher accuracy. A novel 3D object retrieval method is presented which uses a parameterized annotated model of the shape of the class objects, incorporating its main characteristics. The annotated subdivision-based model is fitted onto objects of the class using a deformable model framework, converted to a geometry image and transformed into the wavelet domain. Object retrieval takes place in the wavelet domain. The method does not require user interaction, achieves high accuracy, is efficient for use with large databases, and is suitable for nonrigid object classes. We apply our method to the face recognition domain, one of the most challenging intraclass retrieval tasks. We used the Face Recognition Grand Challenge v2 database, yielding an average verification rate of 95.2 percent at 10-3 false accept rate. The latest results of our work can be found at http://www.cbl.uh.edu/UR8D/.},

@article{Bruhn2006,
abstract = {The recovery of the displacement field between two consecutive frames of an image sequence the so-called optic flow is one of the central problems in computer vision. Allowing a mathematical sound integration of different concepts into a single minimisation framework, variational methods belong to the best performing and best understood techniques for solving this task. They can be designed in such a way that they preserve motion boundaries, treat large displacements correctly, are robust with respect to illumination changes or perform favourably in the presence of noise and occlusions. However, they are hardly used in practical applications, since they require to solve large linear or nonlinear systems of equations. In particular, they are considered to be too slow for those tasks where real-time performance is needed. In this thesis we make two important contributions to the field of variational optic flow computation: Firstly, we provide a systematic toolkit for the design of accurate variational methods. Thereby, we demonstrate that this toolkit allows the construction of the currently most precise optic flow approaches in the literature. Secondly, we present a multigrid framework for the efficient solution of the resulting linear and nonlinear systems of equations. This framework does not only outperform frequently used numerical schemes by up to four orders of magnitude, it even allows the first real-time computation of variational optic flow ever. The first part of this thesis is dedicated to variational optic flow methods for small displacements. Thereby we investigate the systematic design of convex approaches by discussing a variety of established models. In this context, we also introduce several new ideas that improve the quality of the estimation with respect to noise, outliers and varying illumination. Moreover, we present a compact notation for variational optic flow methods that is based on motion and diffusion tensors. This notation proves to be useful in two respects: Firstly, it allows the systematic construction of novel approaches. This is demonstrated by the example of two advanced optic flow techniques. Secondly, it forms the basis of our numerical framework for the design of efficient bidirectional multigrid methods. By resampling these tensors instead of the original image sequence, we present a novel way to create a suitable coarse grid representation that is both computationally efficient and accurate at the same time. Extensive qualitative and quantitative benchmarks for seven different models and six different numerical prototypes show the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed multigrid implementations. The second part of this thesis extends our previous contributions to the case of large displacements. To this end, we introduce an eighth prototype that is based on a nonconvex approach. In order to solve the resulting minimisation problem we derive an incremental coarse-to-fine fixed point iteration that allows to avoid local minima. In this context, we also succeed to provide a theoretical justification for the well-known warping technique that has been motivated only on an algorithmic basis so far. Moreover, we define a new motion tensor equivalent for the case of large displacements. This allows us to extend our compact notation and therewith our highly efficient multigrid framework that we developed before. Quality and efficiency benchmarks show the success of this generalisation: While the speedups are similar than in the case of small displacements, the accuracy is even higher.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

abstract = "Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. "

        abstract = {We propose a correlation-based approach to parametric object alignment particularly suitable for face analysis applications which require efficiency and robustness against occlusions and illumination changes. Our algorithm registers two images by iteratively maximizing their correlation coefficient using gradient ascent. We compute this correlation coefficient from complex gradients which capture the orientation of image structures rather than pixel intensities. The maximization of this gradient correlation coefficient results in an algorithm which is as computationally efficient as ?2 norm-based algorithms, can be extended within the inverse compositional framework (without the need for Hessian re-computation) and is robust to outliers. To the best of our knowledge, no other algorithm has been proposed so far having all three features. We show the robustness of our algorithm for the problem of face alignment in the presence of occlusions and non-uniform illumination changes. The code that reproduces the results of our paper can be found at http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources. }

We categorize the various active contour systems according to the definition of the deformable model. We also present in detail one particular formulation for deformable templates which combines edge, texture, color and region information for the external energy and model deformations using wavelets, splines or Fourier descriptors. We explain how these models can be used for segmentation, image retrieval in a large database and object tracking in a video sequence. "

abstract = "Abstract The goal of this paper is to present a new on-line human recognition system, which is able to classify persons with adaptive abilities using an incremental classifier. The proposed incremental \{SVM\} is fast, as its training phase relies on only a few images and it uses the mathematical properties of \{SVM\} to update only the needed parts. In our system, first of all, feature extraction and selection are implemented, based on color and texture features (appearance of the person). Then the incremental \{SVM\} classifier is introduced to recognize a person from a set of 20 persons in \{CASIA\} Gait Database. The proposed incremental classifier is updated step by step when a new frame including a person is presented. With this technique, we achieved a correct classification rate of 98.46%, knowing only 5% of the dataset at the beginning of the experiment. A comparison with a non-incremental technique reaches recognition rate of 99% on the same database. Extended analyses have been carried out and showed that the proposed method can be adapted to on-line setting. "
