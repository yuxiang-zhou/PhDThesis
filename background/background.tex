\label{ch:background}

This section briefly introduce fundamental technologies that current research based on. Section \ref{sec:bg_aam} explains the manner of constructing statistical deformable models using active appearance model. Section \ref{sec:bg_icp} briefly described the mechanical of Iterative Closest Points and the reason of using ICP for pre-processing. Section \ref{sec:bg_svs} introduces a shape discriminator which is infinitely differentiable. Section \ref{sec:bg_opticalflow} brings the technologies of registering video sequences. Our research takes the idea from optical flow in order to put shapes in dense correspondence. Section \ref{sec:SSD} presents the algorithm of steepest descend for minimising error function when fitting objects.
